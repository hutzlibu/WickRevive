<h1>Wick Editor</h1>

The Wick Editor is a free and open-source tool for creating games, animations, and everything in-between. It's designed to be the most accessible tool for creating multimedia projects on the web.

The original wick editor is abandoned - and this is a fork mostly done by claude so far.
